## Overview

This repository is a collection of various web development projects I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes everything from simple static pages to dynamic web applications. The goal is to document my learning process and provide a resource for others interested in front-end development.

## Languages and Technologies

- **HTML**: Markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used to create dynamic content on websites.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/To-Do List**: A simple to-do list application demonstrating basic CRUD operations and DOM manipulation.
- **/Lightbulb**: A simple lightbulb on a website, mostly experimenting with CSS stylings and object manipulation.

## Future Plans

In the near future, I plan to enhance this repository by incorporating:

- **PHP**: For server-side scripting and dynamic web page generation.
- **SQL Databases**: To manage and retrieve data efficiently.
- **IIS (Internet Information Services)**: For hosting and managing web applications on a Windows server.
